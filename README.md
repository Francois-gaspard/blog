# Ruby Middleman Tailwind Starter Blog

A Middleman blog template configured with TailwindCSS, markdown parsing, code highlighting, a sitemap.xml and more. It perfect for lightweight blogging or a personal website. Ruby knowledge is helpful, but not necessary.

This template includes:

- Middleman `v4.5`,
- TailwindCSS `v3.4.3`,
- Markdown support (via `kramdown`),
- Blogging support (via `middleman-blog`),
- Syntax highlighting support (via `middleman-syntax`),
- Automatic sitemap generation,
- `bin/dev` and live-reloading (via `middleman-livereload`),
- Automatic meta tags for `title` and `description`

You can check out the [live template demo](https://main--ruby-middleman-tailwind-starter-blog.netlify.app/) for a preview of how it looks (although of course, you can customize it yourself).

I've used [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) for years to build my personal website, and this template is a consolidation of everything I've learned.
