# About Me

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczMzLYTmJX9NnZpn27c7zhRJ6EbKUa91oRbGZEi4O0xmFMqB4YYhd2Cw_DPDZLmSA4o6jHqWVurbljiTcUWvEjiXVEJ0awDT6VfeIG9lWT2uZDguwUv7=w240)

Hi there! I'm Francois, a seasoned software developer with team-leading experience and a passion for elegant solutions and clean code. 

With over 15 years of experience in the tech industry, I've had the privilege of working on exciting projects ranging from payment gateways to food delivery platforms.

Currently, I'm contributing my skills at Verumex, where I lead efforts to boost team agility and tackle complex challenges. 
My main expertise lies in Ruby on Rails, and I'm always eager to explore new technologies and methodologies that can enhance our development process.

Throughout my career, I've worn many hats - from being a lead developer at OPN (formerly Omise) to managing development teams. 
I'm a firm believer in the power of Agile methodologies to drive efficient, value-focused development.

This blog is my way of finally giving something back to the tech community that has nurtured my growth. 
Here, I'll be sharing insights from my experiences, discussing best practices, and exploring software development trends.

Feel free to connect with me if you share similar interests. Let's learn and grow together!
