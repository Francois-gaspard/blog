# Blog (the,)

Welcome to the blog. It's powered by the `middleman-blog` gem, alongside markdown files.

This is the index page, located at `source/blog.html.md.erb`. The blog extension itself is configured (within `config.rb`) to look inside `source/blog` for individual articles.

Here are some example articles â€”

<ul>
  <% blog.articles.each do |article| %>
    <li class="space-x-4">
        <time>[<%= article.date.strftime('%b %e %Y') %>]</time>
        <%= link_to article.title, article.url %>
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
